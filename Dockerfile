# Integration image.

# Gladys sandbox constraints ("the sandbox is the defense"):
#   - rootfs mounted READ-ONLY -> never write outside /data
#   - a single writable volume: /data
#   - runs as a non-root user
#   - multi-arch image (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64), see the CI workflow
#
# This integration needs no extra privilege to do its job: /proc/stat and
# /proc/meminfo already report the HOST figures inside a container (they are not
# namespaced), Docker mounts /sys read-only by default, and the sysfs thermal
# entries are world-readable — so the unprivileged `node` user is enough.
